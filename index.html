                "The only way to find true happiness is to risk being completely cut open." 
                - Chuck Palahniuk, Invisible Monsters.
            </br>
            </br>
                And what does it mean to be "completely cut open" in today's society? If you 
                are behaving within the boundaries of the law and avoid absolute financial 
                ruin, what is it then? A slice to the ego? Considering the upside of stepping 
                into the arena, that's not a bad risk in my opinion:
            </br>
            </br>
                adventure, dreams, fulfillment - these are the potential rewards of stepping onto the stage.

                    Lately, I've been skimming books more so than reading them start to end. I'll go to 
                    Barnes & Noble, walk down some random aisle, grab a book that piques my interest, 
                    glance at the table of contents, flip to the chapter that sounds most appealing, then 
                    read a paragraph, a page, or the whole chapter. I can understand why the avid reader 
                    would hate me for this, but I think it's a great way to get into the reading groove 
                    and explore new genres. I don't know, what's your opinion on this?
                </br>
                </br>
                    Anyway, this is how I spent my afternoon yesterday. I found a book called "Becoming 
                    Supernatural" by Dr. Joe Dispenza. I admit although I was attracted to the book cover, 
                    the title kind of put me off - it sounded like all those other pseudo-self-help books 
                    that I've been trying to avoid lately (the one genre I'm trying to stay away from at 
                    the moment) but I gave it a try anyway. Flipped to the chapter about staying in the present.
                </br>
                </br>
                    It was a pleasant surprise. I'll try to give a summary of the chapter in the most logical 
                    flow and in my best recollection:
                </br>
                </br>
                    Essentially what Dr. Disepnza argues is that in order to be in the present, one cannot have a 
                    familiar past or a predictable future. By having a familiar past (recalling events, memories, etc.) 
                    then your thoughts evoke the feelings associated with the past, and those feelings evoke the thoughts 
                    associated with the past - you get into a thinking-feeling loop. Then your past becomes your future 
                    because everything is predicted and the feeling/thoughts are already assumed. Consequently, the 
                    narrative that you write in your head reaffirms those thoughts and feelings when those future events 
                    do come, thus fueling the thinking-feeling loop even more. So how does one avoid this loop? By keeping 
                    your energy internal, as external events are always in competition for our energy. By conserving our 
                    energy, we can utilize it for creative tasks and allow the unpredictable and unanticipated events to 
                    occur in our lives, which break us out of the thinking-feeling loop and ultimately allow us to stay 
                    in the present.
                </br>
                </br>
                    There's a lot more depth to the chapter, but these are the nuts and bolts. This is something most of us 
                    probably know already, but it's a good reminder to have; allow unanticipated events to break us out of 
                    the monotonous Groundhog Day limbo.

        <h1 class=title>An Introvert's Party</h1>
                <p class=entry>
                    Chattering: left, right, distant, and near. Music hovering in the sky. A ‘ping’ 
                    - glasses gently touch. A heavy mug set on the counter. A chair scoots back. Typing.
                </br>
                </br>
                    Coffee shops are like bowls of soup, different sounds mixed together to create noise. 
                    A very special kind of noise. You see, sitting over near the windows, typing away at 
                    this with my back facing the party, I’m comfortable in the chaos. I’m not awkwardly 
                    walking around expected to contribute - facing the windows I’m just sight-seeing and 
                    people-watching, car after car, pedestrian after pedestrian.
                </br>
                </br>
                    Do you see the allure? The “coffee shop noise” doesn’t point its finger at the awkward 
                    ones on the dance floor; it opens its arms and creates a quiet vacuum - the eye of the 
                    storm. And so introverts like myself flock to these squares and throw $4, not for the 
                    cup but for the seat.
                </br>
                </br>
                    It’s within etiquette to put headphones on and type away on a laptop. It’s within etiquette 
                    to read a book. It’s within etiquette to play board games. It’s not the traditional party - 
                    it’s the introvert’s party (I wonder if weed cafes will be similar though, once that becomes 
                    mainstream here).
                </br>
                </br>
                    Anyway, before you wonder why people ‘waste’ so much money on coffee, remember that they might 
                    not be paying for the coffee, but for tickets to the party.

                Despite cranking up the heater, I still woke up chilly - there's no 
                escaping the seasons. I immediately went to go put my hoodie on but 
                forgot I recently gave it to my brother. So I put on the usual grey, 
                casual fleece-jacket instead.
            </br>
            </br>
                I'm trying to get rid of things, especially my clothes. The more clothes 
                laying around in the closet, the more energy I'm potentially sacrificing 
                by letting them drain it away; the fewer go-to-outfits I utilize over and 
                over, the more bandwidth I preserve for the day. It's difficult because I love 
                clothes, and usually this time of the year I'm buying and accumulating. I'm 
                going the opposite direction this year.

                Every day is like a piece of string.
            </br>
            </br>
                Most days there is just a slight gust, so the string rests back to 
                equilibrium for the next day. But some days there are storms - the 
                morning and evening routine glue the ends down. Without the glue, 
                the storm blows the string to who-knows-where, and then it's chaos...
            </p>
            </br>
        <h1 class=title>10/3/19 - 7:06 am</h1>

                An observation from my morning drive:
            </br>
            </br>
                It's dark out, and all I can see are the headlights and tail lights. 
                Rain muddles up the view, and then "swoosh" - it's clear. Momentarily. 
                Rain muddles it up again and another "swoosh." It's very satisfying.
            </br>
            </br>
                But it's only when the windshield wipers clean off the rain when I 
                realize how much I appreciate having a clear windshield. During the 
                summer, I think nothing of it.

                It's much easier to run across the beach than swim across the ocean.
            </br>
            </br>
                So if you're lost in the middle of an ocean, just look for a wave - any wave. 
                It doesn't matter where it goes, you just need a current that'll propel you to 
                shore. So give everything a chance. Whether they fit your narrative or not, give 
                it a shot and see what happens because worst-case scenario is you'll end up back 
                where you started, looking for another tide.
            </br>
            </br>
                Once you get to shore, then you can be more peculiar with where you're situated; 
                run over to where the sand is dryer and build the campfire there.

                “You fall in love with the people who make you love the person 
                you are when you’re around them.”
            </br>
            </br>
                I don't know who to attribute this specific quote to, but phrases similar 
                to this are thrown around here and there. It's good wisdom to keep in the 
                back of mind as people's opinions on others typically have more to do with 
                themselves than that other person. It's beneficial to practice also, 
                especially if you're looking to develop social skills:
            </br>
            </br>
                Make the other person feel good about themselves, and they will feel good 
                about you. That's how you turn a stranger into an acquaintance, an 
                acquaintance into a friend.

        <h1 class=title>9/30/19 - 5:23 am</h1>
            <p class=entry>
                I was sitting in a coffee shop one day when a guy sat down directly to my left: <br>
                "Hey, how's it going?"
            </br>
            </br>
                We ended up talking for 3 hours.
            </br>
            </br>
                ...
            </br>
            </br>
                I remember how inspired I was, seeing how easy it was for him to greet me, 
                a stranger. I remember it was then I realized that going up to a stranger 
                and saying "hi" is the modern superpower - the easiest way for one to 
                completely shift the trajectory of their life.
            </br>
            </br>
                Imagine if you made the habit to approach strangers and just introduce yourself. 
                Think of the potential opportunities: friendships, job opportunities, hobbies, 
                projects, memories, etc... The easiest way to stumble upon a miracle is by someone 
                giving it to you. The more people you know, the more opportunities for 
                transformative intervention.
            </br>
            </br>
                ...
            </br>
            </br>
                I've been to coffee shops many times since, but have yet to greet the stranger 
                to my right or left.

                The PNW 'gloom' as I like to call it is beginning to roll in. 
                A stirring pot of wet, cold, fog, and grey from now till March - 
                that's the 'gloom.' Seasonal depression is a real thing around here 
                and so it's incredibly important to remain active, as opposed to 
                bundling up in a dark room with Netflix all-day, all-week, all-season...
            </br> 
            </br>
                But on the bright side, at least I get to layer up. I'm excited 
                to wear some jackets and sweaters again.

                    In an earlier post, I mentioned that the first thing I do every 
                    morning is I drink a glass of water. I'm gonna change up the routine.
                </br>
                </br>
                    Before the glass of water, the first thing to do is roll the blinds, 
                    crack the window open and take in a deep breath of the fresh, morning 
                    air - in through the nostrils and out through the mouth. The 6 am air 
                    has a minty, healing power to it; it's like toothpaste for the mind. 
                    Why wait till I get to the coffee shop to breathe it in? I have the 
                    luxury to do so first thing in the morning, so that's what I'll begin 
                    to do. Besides, it's only until I step out of my room and walk back 
                    in when I realize how muggy it is at times - probably best to brush 
                    the junk out ASAP.

                Being the first one to the office every morning, I get to enjoy some quiet time to myself.<br>
                All I can hear is the highway in the distance, the stream of cars speeding along the pavement.<br>
                But today, I happened to glance at the clock and noticed: tick-tock-tick-tock-tick-tock...
            </br>
            </br>
                The clock now echoes throughout the office.
