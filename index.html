                The PNW 'gloom' as I like to call it is beginning to roll in. 
                A stirring pot of wet, cold, fog, and grey from now till March - 
                that's the 'gloom.' Seasonal depression is a real thing around here 
                and so it's incredibly important to remain active, as opposed to 
                bundling up in a dark room with Netflix all-day, all-week, all-season...
            </br> 
            </br>
                But on the bright side, at least I get to layer up. I'm excited 
                to wear some jackets and sweaters again.

                    In an earlier post, I mentioned that the first thing I do every 
                    morning is I drink a glass of water. I'm gonna change up the routine.
                </br>
                </br>
                    Before the glass of water, the first thing to do is roll the blinds, 
                    crack the window open and take in a deep breath of the fresh, morning 
                    air - in through the nostrils and out through the mouth. The 6 am air 
                    has a minty, healing power to it; it's like toothpaste for the mind. 
                    Why wait till I get to the coffee shop to breathe it in? I have the 
                    luxury to do so first thing in the morning, so that's what I'll begin 
                    to do. Besides, it's only until I step out of my room and walk back 
                    in when I realize how muggy it is at times - probably best to brush 
                    the junk out ASAP.

                Being the first one to the office every morning, I get to enjoy some quiet time to myself.<br>
                All I can hear is the highway in the distance, the stream of cars speeding along the pavement.<br>
                But today, I happened to glance at the clock and noticed: tick-tock-tick-tock-tick-tock...
            </br>
            </br>
                The clock now echoes throughout the office.
