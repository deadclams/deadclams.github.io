                An observation from my morning drive:
            </br>
            </br>
                It's dark out, and all I can see are the headlights and tail lights. 
                Rain muddles up the view, and then "swoosh" - it's clear. Momentarily. 
                Rain muddles it up again and another "swoosh." It's very satisfying.
            </br>
            </br>
                But it's only when the windshield wipers clean off the rain when I 
                realize how much I appreciate having a clear windshield. During the 
                summer, I think nothing of it.

                It's much easier to run across the beach than swim across the ocean.
            </br>
            </br>
                So if you're lost in the middle of an ocean, just look for a wave - any wave. 
                It doesn't matter where it goes, you just need a current that'll propel you to 
                shore. So give everything a chance. Whether they fit your narrative or not, give 
                it a shot and see what happens because worst-case scenario is you'll end up back 
                where you started, looking for another tide.
            </br>
            </br>
                Once you get to shore, then you can be more peculiar with where you're situated; 
                run over to where the sand is dryer and build the campfire there.

                “You fall in love with the people who make you love the person 
                you are when you’re around them.”
            </br>
            </br>
                I don't know who to attribute this specific quote to, but phrases similar 
                to this are thrown around here and there. It's good wisdom to keep in the 
                back of mind as people's opinions on others typically have more to do with 
                themselves than that other person. It's beneficial to practice also, 
                especially if you're looking to develop social skills:
            </br>
            </br>
                Make the other person feel good about themselves, and they will feel good 
                about you. That's how you turn a stranger into an acquaintance, an 
                acquaintance into a friend.

                I was sitting in a coffee shop one day when a guy sat down directly to my left: <br>
                "Hey, how's it going?"
            </br>
            </br>
                We ended up talking for 3 hours.
            </br>
            </br>
                ...
            </br>
            </br>
                I remember how inspired I was, seeing how easy it was for him to greet me, 
                a stranger. I remember it was then I realized that going up to a stranger 
                and saying "hi" is the modern superpower - the easiest way for one to 
                completely shift the trajectory of their life.
            </br>
            </br>
                Imagine if you made the habit to approach strangers and just introduce yourself. 
                Think of the potential opportunities: friendships, job opportunities, hobbies, 
                projects, memories, etc... The easiest way to stumble upon a miracle is by someone 
                giving it to you. The more people you know, the more opportunities for 
                transformative intervention.
            </br>
            </br>
                ...
            </br>
            </br>
                I've been to coffee shops many times since, but have yet to greet the stranger 
                to my right or left.

                The PNW 'gloom' as I like to call it is beginning to roll in. 
                A stirring pot of wet, cold, fog, and grey from now till March - 
                that's the 'gloom.' Seasonal depression is a real thing around here 
                and so it's incredibly important to remain active, as opposed to 
                bundling up in a dark room with Netflix all-day, all-week, all-season...
            </br> 
            </br>
                But on the bright side, at least I get to layer up. I'm excited 
                to wear some jackets and sweaters again.

                    In an earlier post, I mentioned that the first thing I do every 
                    morning is I drink a glass of water. I'm gonna change up the routine.
                </br>
                </br>
                    Before the glass of water, the first thing to do is roll the blinds, 
                    crack the window open and take in a deep breath of the fresh, morning 
                    air - in through the nostrils and out through the mouth. The 6 am air 
                    has a minty, healing power to it; it's like toothpaste for the mind. 
                    Why wait till I get to the coffee shop to breathe it in? I have the 
                    luxury to do so first thing in the morning, so that's what I'll begin 
                    to do. Besides, it's only until I step out of my room and walk back 
                    in when I realize how muggy it is at times - probably best to brush 
                    the junk out ASAP.
            </p>

                Being the first one to the office every morning, I get to enjoy some quiet time to myself.<br>
                All I can hear is the highway in the distance, the stream of cars speeding along the pavement.<br>
                But today, I happened to glance at the clock and noticed: tick-tock-tick-tock-tick-tock...
            </br>
            </br>
                The clock now echoes throughout the office.
