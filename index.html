                I thought it'd be neat for us to communicate with one another outside the constraints of these entries so I've made a Discord Server that we can utilize. Let's get to know one another there.
            </br>
            </br>
                And I thought today was Tuesday - it's already Wednesday?

                It's dark, wet, and windy this morning, yet, surprisingly warm - almost feels like the harbinger 
                for a storm. The leaves are losing their vibrant fall-colors and turning dead-brown; the branches 
                are letting go of them. The nights are creeping into the early evening, intruding upon the day. 
                And the pedestrians slouch with hoodies on, weighed down by the rain and thick, emotionless overcast.

                A child who can’t share - who can’t trade - can’t have any friends, because having friends 
                is a form of trade. - Jordan Peterson, 12 Rules For Life
            </br>
            </br>
                I'm not the biggest fan of self-help books, but this book happened to be lying around in the 
                house so I skimmed through it - I thought this quote was worth writing down and remembering. 
                In this hyper-individualistic culture (at least in the West), it's good to remember that nobody 
                is entitled to having friends, and that cultivating relationships require an exchange - a give 
                and take. This past weekend reminded me that having friends is a trade worth participating in.

                I'm the last one in the house. My friends crashed here last night; they all left, 
                even Josh (he's in LA right now but this is his home) is gone. We had a little too 
                much fun bar hopping last night, and I had to pay my dues hovering over the toilet 
                seat at 4 am. I was (literally) puking my guts out. So here I am, hungover and getting 
                in this very late entry. Getting ready to head back to Portland now. Had a fun trip up 
                here and it was great seeing friends. We're already talking about what we'll do next 
                year for the summer of 2020... thinking about going to Europe, but we'll see.

                "This too shall pass."
            </br>
            </br>
                Google tells me the origin of this quote is a Persian adage - it seems nobody knows who to exactly contribute it to. 
                But it's such a good one and captures a great truth of life, that everything is fleeting. Good and bad, they will all 
                pass. And so hanging out with my friends for a couple more days, I want to keep this quote in the back of my mind; to 
                not be distracted by anything else other than the present moment itself, and to enjoy it before it too passes.

                Such a late entry - I'm up in Seattle visiting friends, so my routine will be out the window until Monday. Went out to a 
                park with Josh late last night, midnight I think, to smoke a couple of joints. Haven't smoked weed in a very long time. 
                I didn't think it had any effect but waking up this morning, it must've hit as I was sleeping - it was a struggle getting up today.

                Everyone needs a small vacation at some point to debrief, relax, and get out of routine for a bit. Planning one in the coming 
                months will at least give you something to look forward to.

                The bucket list idea I proposed yesterday can be a strategy for initiative and progress, but there might be 
                a better one out there; the key with strategies is that you need to find one that works for you. Some need one 
                that's more rigid and provides lots of structure, others need one that simply provides direction and nothing else 
                - they need breathing room to react and be creative. The key is to know what balance you need on the scale and find 
                a strategy that works best for you.
            </br>
            </br>
                For example, if you need 80% structure and 20% breathing room, then maybe you should adopt the "Time Blocking" method 
                to organize your day; conversely, if you need 20% structure and 80% breathing room, then maybe you just need to jot down 
                your top 3 priorities of the day on scrap paper...
            </p>

                Some people have bucket lists. And most bucket lists are filled with huge, grandeur-type tasks. 
                They're like a glorified to-do list, but a to-do list is typically filled with things that 'must be done' 
                whereas you only put the things you 'want to do' in the bucket.
            </br>
            </br>
                But what about having a bucket list of smaller, more every-day things you 'want to do' instead? I think it 
                could be a good strategy for initiative and progress. Like, cooking a new meal, or trying a new workout, or 
                reading a new book, or talking to a stranger, or visiting a new coffee shop - nothing too monumental (for 
                most people anyway) but still chips away at the monotonous everyday to uncover something new.

                    Some of the democratic candidates are wanting to eradicate student loans. I had an interesting 
                    conversation with someone about this (not about politics, but about the idea of student loans). 
                    Getting rid of student loans, on the surface, is a great idea obviously. But some issues that 
                    could arise are:
                </br>
                </br>
                    In the short term, I predict those who worked their ass off to get rid of their loans will be pissed.
                </br>
                </br>
                    In the long term, the undergraduate degree would become the new high school diploma. Consequently, 
                    more people would flock to graduate school, more bullshit graduate degrees will be made to reel students 
                    in, more debt (I assume graduate school debt will still need to be paid) and the cycle continues.
                </br>
                </br>
                    What's your opinion on this topic? (Please keep politics out of the discussion. Don't want any political 
                    statements made here).

                    "I am not absentminded. It is the presence of mind that makes me unaware of everything else." 
                    - G.K. Chesterton
                </br>
                </br>
                    We have 24 hours each day. Let's assume we spend 8 hours asleep - that gives us 16 waking hours. 
                    How many of those 16 hours do you spend actually awake, outside your head and in the real world? 
                    Or another way of putting it is, how many of those 16 hours do you waste in your head?
                </br>
                </br>
                    Not that thinking is useless but to exert a good chunk of your energy pondering with the opportunity 
                    cost of the present moment isn't a good idea; I think the mind is most effective when we tap into it 
                    periodically throughout the day or use it to reflect in one sitting. But letting it suck your attention 
                    into its vacuum causes idleness.
                </br>

                    The smartphone is distracting. But the mind can be even more distracting.

                The leaves are all just about red and orange and yellow now. The fall colors are so fleeting 
                - they don't hang on very long once they change color. So I'm trying to take a moment each day 
                to just look at them and appreciate them. Before they slip off and I have to wait till next 
                year again.

        <h1 class=title>Up Here</h1>
            <p class=entry>
                Up here the world has its own horizon. The light poles blast a white haze over the empty 
                parking lot on the lower half and the sky leaves an empty starless black on the upper half. 
                The usual-light concrete is darkened with wet glaze today, like the shiny floors of modern 
                coffee shops. The wide ramp leans into the floor below, the tall light poles are scattered 
                throughout, and the heavy parking blocks are set along the perimeter. The enormous size of 
                this space gives you the freedom to race around like a speed skater on an ice-skating rink. 
                That’s what this place is: a squared, board-skating rink.
            </br>
            </br>
                ...
            </br>
            </br>
                Skating in the 2 am morning pulls a slow and cool breeze out of the still and suspended air. 
                The wind blows with a pleasant yet icy sharpness, cutting out the mental-clutter. And because 
                of the shower earlier on, there’s a hint of that concrete smell leaking in the air, giving an 
                earthy aroma in every stride. While I’m drifting around all I hear are the wheels underneath 
                rolling on the pavement so consistently that it’s white noise, and everything else is silent. 
                Even my thoughts are muted, unable to come out in the first place because they’re drowned by 
                it all, gliding out here. I’m just feeling, not thinking, pondering, worrying, imagining, or 
                doing whatever else with my fucking head that makes me miserable. I roam around, give a kick and 
                feel the gust that comes with it fade into a light trace as I stretch into a float. And then I 
                give another kick.
            </br>
            </br>
                ...
            </br>
            </br>
                Nature and city have a partnership up here. A much different relationship than what’s encompassed 
                in urban parks for example (which I do enjoy spending time in) but with the occasional honks ripping 
                through the leaves and over the benches, I’m always reminded that I’m in a city. Up here, nature and 
                city tag-team: I feel like I’m sight-seeing at the downtown lights through a sophisticated high-rise 
                office window, but on the other side of the lot I feel like I’m gazing through foreign and fresh green 
                air of a rural hiking trail. It’s revitalizing, to roll in-between both nature and city-life perfectly 
                balanced on both sides.
            </br>
            </br>
                ...
            </br>
            </br>
                Usually, I look over and Trevor will already be at the other side of the lot – he’ll show off and fly around 
                like a bullet. Josh will be over at the perimeter, carving in-between and around the car stoppers. Will and 
                Ian like to hang around the middle, near the entrance of the ramp, trying to flip their boards and practice 
                new tricks. It’s why we come up here, to escape the modern society of clutter and information and noise, a 
                society that has transformed human into cyborg. Up here, we escape and just be – in the now, without the burden 
                of thinking. Up here, we revert back from programmed machines to uncomplicated creatures that breathe, sees, and 
                feels, free from the juggling of
            </br>
            </br>
                “why?” or </br>
                “what for?” or </br>
                “what will I do after this?” or </br>
                “how will this improve me?” or </br>
                (the even more ridiculous in my humble opinion) </br>
                “what is my purpose?” or </br>
                “what am I supposed to be?” 
            </br>
            </br>
                Up here, your purpose is to circle from point A to point A, however you want to, without time limit, without 
                responsibility. You glide around, you breathe, and you look at the view. The freedom is the human equivalent of 
                dogs sticking their heads out the car window. It’s not just therapeutic, it’s natural. That’s why I’m up here – 
                I escape and find that freedom.

                My workout regimen was starting to get a little boring, so I was looking to incorporate 
                something new. I stumbled upon the "Medicine Ball Throw Down" exercise. It's a keeper.
            </br>
            </br>
                I've used 15, 18, 20, and 25 lb medicine balls so far - I think 18 is the sweet spot. 
                25 reps, 4-5 sets, and I'm out. A full-body exercise. Compound movements are my favorite 
                and this fits right in that toolbox. If you're looking to spice up your gym routine, I'd 
                throw these in the mix (no pun intended).

                Since several years ago, I've utilized one of those big wall calendars every day. I 
                have it on my desk and write all my tasks on there, cross off the completed tasks with 
                a horizontal dash and mark off the days with a big "X" - this practice has helped in 
                making me more organized and responsible for my obligations. But just recently I've 
                found another merit in this routine: I'm slowing down time. Just a little.
            </br>
            </br>
                Even when I'm crossing days off one "X" at a time, the weekends roll around beat after 
                beat. But at least with the calendar, I can catch myself when I start to slip into limbo. 
                If it wasn't for the large "X's" the days would go by that much faster, Saturday then 
                Saturday, Fall then Summer.
            </br>
            </br>
                If you have some empty space on your desk, maybe it's for a calendar?

                Arms shaking, a scrunched face, I pushed the barbell with everything I had. 
                That was the 10th rep. Yet, if I had gone into the set with the goal of 11 reps, 
                I'm confident I would've been able to do 11 - the 10th would've been easier 
                and the 11th would've been the difficult one.
            </br>
            </br>
                An underachieving goal can stagnate performance. Make sure it's set high enough that 
                it pushes you to your maximum potential.

            </br>
            </br>
                And what does it mean to be "completely cut open" in today's society? If you 
                are behaving within the boundaries of the law and avoid absolute financial 
                ruin, what is it then? A slice to the ego? Considering the upside of stepping 
                into the arena, that's not a bad risk in my opinion:
            </br>
            </br>
                adventure, dreams, fulfillment - these are the potential rewards of stepping onto the stage.

                    Lately, I've been skimming books more so than reading them start to end. I'll go to 
                    Barnes & Noble, walk down some random aisle, grab a book that piques my interest, 
                    glance at the table of contents, flip to the chapter that sounds most appealing, then 
                    read a paragraph, a page, or the whole chapter. I can understand why the avid reader 
                    would hate me for this, but I think it's a great way to get into the reading groove 
                    and explore new genres. I don't know, what's your opinion on this?
                </br>
                </br>
                    Anyway, this is how I spent my afternoon yesterday. I found a book called "Becoming 
                    Supernatural" by Dr. Joe Dispenza. I admit although I was attracted to the book cover, 
                    the title kind of put me off - it sounded like all those other pseudo-self-help books 
                    that I've been trying to avoid lately (the one genre I'm trying to stay away from at 
                    the moment) but I gave it a try anyway. Flipped to the chapter about staying in the present.
                </br>
                </br>
                    It was a pleasant surprise. I'll try to give a summary of the chapter in the most logical 
                    flow and in my best recollection:
                </br>
                </br>
                    Essentially what Dr. Disepnza argues is that in order to be in the present, one cannot have a 
                    familiar past or a predictable future. By having a familiar past (recalling events, memories, etc.) 
                    then your thoughts evoke the feelings associated with the past, and those feelings evoke the thoughts 
                    associated with the past - you get into a thinking-feeling loop. Then your past becomes your future 
                    because everything is predicted and the feeling/thoughts are already assumed. Consequently, the 
                    narrative that you write in your head reaffirms those thoughts and feelings when those future events 
                    do come, thus fueling the thinking-feeling loop even more. So how does one avoid this loop? By keeping 
                    your energy internal, as external events are always in competition for our energy. By conserving our 
                    energy, we can utilize it for creative tasks and allow the unpredictable and unanticipated events to 
                    occur in our lives, which break us out of the thinking-feeling loop and ultimately allow us to stay 
                    in the present.
                </br>
                </br>
                    There's a lot more depth to the chapter, but these are the nuts and bolts. This is something most of us 
                    probably know already, but it's a good reminder to have; allow unanticipated events to break us out of 
                    the monotonous Groundhog Day limbo.

        <h1 class=title>An Introvert's Party</h1>
                <p class=entry>
                    Chattering: left, right, distant, and near. Music hovering in the sky. A ‘ping’ 
                    - glasses gently touch. A heavy mug set on the counter. A chair scoots back. Typing.
                </br>
                </br>
                    Coffee shops are like bowls of soup, different sounds mixed together to create noise. 
                    A very special kind of noise. You see, sitting over near the windows, typing away at 
                    this with my back facing the party, I’m comfortable in the chaos. I’m not awkwardly 
                    walking around expected to contribute - facing the windows I’m just sight-seeing and 
                    people-watching, car after car, pedestrian after pedestrian.
                </br>
                </br>
                    Do you see the allure? The “coffee shop noise” doesn’t point its finger at the awkward 
                    ones on the dance floor; it opens its arms and creates a quiet vacuum - the eye of the 
                    storm. And so introverts like myself flock to these squares and throw $4, not for the 
                    cup but for the seat.
                </br>
                </br>
                    It’s within etiquette to put headphones on and type away on a laptop. It’s within etiquette 
                    to read a book. It’s within etiquette to play board games. It’s not the traditional party - 
                    it’s the introvert’s party (I wonder if weed cafes will be similar though, once that becomes 
                    mainstream here).
                </br>
                </br>
                    Anyway, before you wonder why people ‘waste’ so much money on coffee, remember that they might 
                    not be paying for the coffee, but for tickets to the party.

                Despite cranking up the heater, I still woke up chilly - there's no 
                escaping the seasons. I immediately went to go put my hoodie on but 
                forgot I recently gave it to my brother. So I put on the usual grey, 
                casual fleece-jacket instead.
            </br>
            </br>
                I'm trying to get rid of things, especially my clothes. The more clothes 
                laying around in the closet, the more energy I'm potentially sacrificing 
                by letting them drain it away; the fewer go-to-outfits I utilize over and 
                over, the more bandwidth I preserve for the day. It's difficult because I love 
                clothes, and usually this time of the year I'm buying and accumulating. I'm 
                going the opposite direction this year.

                Every day is like a piece of string.
            </br>
            </br>
                Most days there is just a slight gust, so the string rests back to 
                equilibrium for the next day. But some days there are storms - the 
                morning and evening routine glue the ends down. Without the glue, 
                the storm blows the string to who-knows-where, and then it's chaos...

                An observation from my morning drive:
            </br>
            </br>
                It's dark out, and all I can see are the headlights and tail lights. 
                Rain muddles up the view, and then "swoosh" - it's clear. Momentarily. 
                Rain muddles it up again and another "swoosh." It's very satisfying.
            </br>
            </br>
                But it's only when the windshield wipers clean off the rain when I 
                realize how much I appreciate having a clear windshield. During the 
                summer, I think nothing of it.

                It's much easier to run across the beach than swim across the ocean.
            </br>
            </br>
                So if you're lost in the middle of an ocean, just look for a wave - any wave. 
                It doesn't matter where it goes, you just need a current that'll propel you to 
                shore. So give everything a chance. Whether they fit your narrative or not, give 
                it a shot and see what happens because worst-case scenario is you'll end up back 
                where you started, looking for another tide.
            </br>
            </br>
                Once you get to shore, then you can be more peculiar with where you're situated; 
                run over to where the sand is dryer and build the campfire there.

                “You fall in love with the people who make you love the person 
                you are when you’re around them.”
            </br>
            </br>
                I don't know who to attribute this specific quote to, but phrases similar 
                to this are thrown around here and there. It's good wisdom to keep in the 
                back of mind as people's opinions on others typically have more to do with 
                themselves than that other person. It's beneficial to practice also, 
                especially if you're looking to develop social skills:
            </br>
            </br>
                Make the other person feel good about themselves, and they will feel good 
                about you. That's how you turn a stranger into an acquaintance, an 
                acquaintance into a friend.

                I was sitting in a coffee shop one day when a guy sat down directly to my left: <br>
                "Hey, how's it going?"
            </br>
            </br>
                We ended up talking for 3 hours.
            </br>
            </br>
                ...
            </br>
            </br>
                I remember how inspired I was, seeing how easy it was for him to greet me, 
                a stranger. I remember it was then I realized that going up to a stranger 
                and saying "hi" is the modern superpower - the easiest way for one to 
                completely shift the trajectory of their life.
            </br>
            </br>
                Imagine if you made the habit to approach strangers and just introduce yourself. 
                Think of the potential opportunities: friendships, job opportunities, hobbies, 
                projects, memories, etc... The easiest way to stumble upon a miracle is by someone 
                giving it to you. The more people you know, the more opportunities for 
                transformative intervention.
            </br>
            </br>
                ...
            </br>
            </br>
                I've been to coffee shops many times since, but have yet to greet the stranger 
                to my right or left.

                The PNW 'gloom' as I like to call it is beginning to roll in. 
                A stirring pot of wet, cold, fog, and grey from now till March - 
                that's the 'gloom.' Seasonal depression is a real thing around here 
                and so it's incredibly important to remain active, as opposed to 
                bundling up in a dark room with Netflix all-day, all-week, all-season...
            </br> 
            </br>
                But on the bright side, at least I get to layer up. I'm excited 
                to wear some jackets and sweaters again.

                    In an earlier post, I mentioned that the first thing I do every 
                    morning is I drink a glass of water. I'm gonna change up the routine.
                </br>
                </br>
                    Before the glass of water, the first thing to do is roll the blinds, 
                    crack the window open and take in a deep breath of the fresh, morning 
                    air - in through the nostrils and out through the mouth. The 6 am air 
                    has a minty, healing power to it; it's like toothpaste for the mind. 
                    Why wait till I get to the coffee shop to breathe it in? I have the 
                    luxury to do so first thing in the morning, so that's what I'll begin 
                    to do. Besides, it's only until I step out of my room and walk back 
                    in when I realize how muggy it is at times - probably best to brush 
                    the junk out ASAP.

                All I can hear is the highway in the distance, the stream of cars speeding along the pavement.<br>
